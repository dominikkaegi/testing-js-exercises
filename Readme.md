2. Install all the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`

3. Run the all the tests with `npm test`, to run only specific tests press `p` to apply the filter. You can also run the tests of an specfic exercise by running `npm run ex1`, `npm run ex2` etc.

You can also run with the following command: `npm run exx 1`

In this section we go a step fruther and start testing asynchronous. Create tests to see if the mightyComputer is able to calculate the meaning of life.

# Exercise 3

Here, we have an Api Call that brings ramdom value, so in order to have a consistent test, we need to intercept the API Call, but make sure that the implementation of the function is the same.
